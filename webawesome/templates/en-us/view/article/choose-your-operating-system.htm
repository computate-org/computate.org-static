                  versions of Linux, which one is the most stable, helpful and secure? Hello, my name is Christopher Tate. I am a
                  Red Hat Red Hat Principal Software Engineer and I love open source software. I&#x27;ve tried many operating
                  systems over the years. After switching to linux a decade ago, I&#x27;ve tried many Linux distros. In terms of
                  stability, usefulness, and security, I will always choose Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and I&#x27;ll help you get
                  started on Red Hat Enterprise Linux too.
