    <h2>Proprietary operating systems</h2>
    <p>
      Proprietary operating systems like MacOSX, and especially Microsoft Windows are not set up for open source software development. 
    </p>
    <h3>Apple MacOSX</h3>
    <p>
      The package management system of MacOSX is tightly linked to the operating system and how old your Apple computer hardware is. 
      When your MacOSX operating system is a few years out of date, it will stop providing software updates. 
      Based on the age of your MacOSX hardware, you will no longer be able to receive operating system upgrades. 
      This will render your software developer packages obsolete and broken. 
    </p>
    <h3>Microsoft Windows</h3>
    <p>
      Microsoft Windows does not come with any developer tools out of the box. 
      In order to obtain developer tools, you need to download them manually from the Web. 
      Windows does not provide open source Linux plackages in a native way. 
      This makes it very difficult to use source control, virtualization, containers, and install open source software packages. 
    </p>
    <h2>Open source operating systems</h2>
    <h3>Linux</h3>
    <p>
      Each version of Linux gives you access to many open source software packages, and the source code is always available for any missing packages in Linux. 
      Linux packages make it easy to run the software you need without having to compile the source code. 
      Because some Linux operating systems don't maintain as many packages, you may have to compile some open source software for your projects. 
      Learning to install packages and compile open source code is one of the tasks of an open source software developer. 
      These skills allow you to build your own solutions and integrate other open source community solutions without having to rely on proprietary software services. 
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are ready to change your operating system to Linux, it means that you are ready to embrace open source software. 
      I would like to show you how to fully embrace open source software.
