        Data driven websites are built for organizational outcomes to model actual data that can be accessed publicly or access controlled using an external identity provider for authentication and authorization. 
        Users must enter authentication credentials before being authorized to access certain data in the website. 
        SPINE Programming Theory has easy to follow rules into code comments for defining data models and web pages for creating, accessing, and modifying data. 
        A SPINE Programmer installs a local AI agent watcher service, provided by the Java java.nio.file.WatchService, to watch the programmer’s code project directories for created and modified file events. 
        A distributed application cluster manager provides scalable file locking capabilities when generating code without conflicts. 
        An open source search engine is used by the watcher service to store a complete structured index of your local code parts as they are added or modified. 
        The same event driven watcher service that is used to index your codebase, performs introspection on the code and generates additional code for the developer running directly on the developer's computer. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Additional rules can be written into the Java class comments for defining user groups with policies and permissions to access resources with various scopes to GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE and import data. 
        Data driven websites require data APIs to query, create, and patch data in web compatible formats like JSON. 
        The same scope based permissions for accessing data in a website should be the same as accessing the data in a JSON API. 
        For this reason, SPINE Programming makes it easy to build consistent APIs and web pages with the same permissions required for each user on each request to access the model data, whether that is in web page form or as a JSON API.
