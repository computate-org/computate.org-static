              <a href="https://www.fiware.org/about-us/">FIWARE</a> is a non-profit organization, headquartered in Berlin. 
              They have a mission of building an open, sustainable ecosystem around public, royalty-free, and implementation-driven software platform standards for the development of smart solutions in multiple sectors, following a digital twin approach. 
              In 2022, I heard that the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/social-innovation">Red Hat Social Innovation Program</a> started an <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/success-stories/fiware">innovative engagement with FIWARE</a> to harness the power of open source technologies to solve global problems. 
              I helped start the conversations with FIWARE and the Red Hat Social Innovation Program as the Social Innovation Architect. 
              I also started a related <a href="https://research.redhat.com/blog/research_project/creating-a-global-open-research-platform-to-better-understand-social-sustainability-using-data-from-a-real-life-smart-village/">research project with Boston University</a>, the <a href="https://www.bu.edu/rhcollab/">Red Hat Collaboratory with Boston University</a>, and <a href="https://veberod.nu/category/smarta-byar/">Smarta Byar</a> in Veber√∂d, Sweden.

              I also attended the 2022 FIWARE Global Summit in Gran Canaria, Spain, and presented about our FIWARE Innovation Hub on the way at Boston University. 
              Because of the open source value for FIWARE provided for building smart solutions, I started a FIWARE iHub between Red Hat and Boston University. 
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2024, the FIWARE community reached out to me and other iHubs, to start some discussions about community building related to standards for IoT smart device computing. 
              The target domains included smart cities, smart ports, and smart agriculture. 
              The focus was on how the FIWARE community, including the FIWARE iHubs, can help. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I was asked to prepare a panel discussion with 4 other FIWARE iHubs at the upcoming FIWARE Global Summit. 
              This would enhance community cooperation, contribution, and participation with FIWARE's approach to "Think global, act local." 
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to preparing for this upcoming panel discussion, I decided to focus on developing some new tools within my computate platform to support FIWARE use cases of Smart Data Models. 
              I also developed a free course that runs on the Red Hat OpenShift Developer Sandbox. 
              I was also building the Computate Smart Website Builder that allows software developers to build a custom data-driven website powered by FIWARE. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I wanted to put together a complete solution for the FIWARE community to deploy FIWARE microservices to the very best enterprise open source cloud environment, 
              create Smart Data Models, 
              register entities with the IoT Agent and Context Broker, 
              and visualize their data in a computate platform. 
            </p>
            <p>
              To be continued...
