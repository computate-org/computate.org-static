              Overview
            </h2>
            <p>
              The Red Hat OpenShift Observability use case began in July 2022, after I switched teams at Red Hat from Financial Services Industry Consulting to the Red Hat Research team. 
              In Red Hat Research, in addition to working on the <a href="https://research.redhat.com/blog/research_project/creating-a-global-open-research-platform-to-better-understand-social-sustainability-using-data-from-a-real-life-smart-village/">Smarta Byar Smart Village research project</a>, I was asked to deploy Red Hat ACM Observability and Loki Logging to the New England Research Cloud OpenShift environment. 
              I made my <a href="https://github.com/OCP-on-NERC/nerc-ocp-config/pull/41">first pull request</a> for the New England Research Cloud to add ACM Observability resources to the infrastructure OpenShift cluster. 
              I proceeded to <a href="https://github.com/OCP-on-NERC/nerc-ocp-config/pull/69">configure the new Loki Stack for multi-cluster logging</a>, for a centralized log search solution to replace the no longer open source Elasticsearch solution for logs in OpenShift in the past. 
              It also involved deploying the <a href="https://github.com/OCP-on-NERC/nerc-ocp-config/pull/70">OpenShift Logging Operator</a> and log forwarding from each of the clusters to a central log solution on the infrastructure cluster. 
              I wrote up some <a href="https://github.com/OCP-on-NERC/docs/blob/main/monitoring-and-logging.md">monitoring and logging documentation</a> for the New England Research cloud to wrap things up in 2022 for most of the <a href="https://github.com/OCP-on-NERC/docs/blob/main/acceptance-tests.md#data-management">data management acceptance tests</a> in the New England Research Cloud.

              Troubleshooting storage
            </h2>
            <p>
              After the new year 2023, there still remained some trouble with object storage for logging as I found out after the holidays.
